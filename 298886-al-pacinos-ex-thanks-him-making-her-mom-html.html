She then leaves it until the next day, when she wraps it in cloth with prosciutto and bakes it in the oven.</p><p class=dh>D'Angelo also revealed her respect for her ex-partner by saying he is a rare talent She is also a trained actress, but D'Angelo decided to take a step back from acting to focus on raising her two children.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Why Did Beverly D'Angelo's Ex-spouse Divorce Her When She Met Al Pacino?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>D'Angelo and Pacino had an unconventional start to their relationship.
