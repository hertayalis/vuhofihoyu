When she finally visited him in August of 2020,&nbsp;the scene&nbsp;inside&nbsp;his&nbsp;lavish&nbsp;Park City, Utah,&nbsp;compound terrified her.</p><p>The&nbsp;floors of the house were covered with empty canisters of nitrous oxide, the mind-altering gas that&nbsp;Hsieh, 46,&nbsp;huffed constantly. His emaciated frame quivered with excitement as he babbled about plans to start a new country and solve world peace.</p><p>Sink and shower faucets ran&nbsp;day and night to evoke the sound of waterfalls. Dog droppings lay wherever Hsieh’s treasured terrier, Blizzy, left them — they were “parts of nature,” the tech guru said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">As CEO of Zappos.com, Hsieh was heralded for his embrace of employee happiness. But he was also living an erratic and tragic life of his own, surrounded by flunkies who did little to save him from his demons. The new book “Happy at Any Cost” looks at his downfall. <span class=credit>NY Post photo composite</span></figure><p>Fascinated by fire, Hsieh kept hundreds of candles burning throughout the house, while a fire ring in his bedroom blazed with an open flame. Dozens of paid hangers-on who lived with him in the mansion he called “the Ranch” seemed oblivious to their bizarre surroundings.</p><p>Jewel, who has run a mental health nonprofit in the years since her pop heyday in the 1990s, could <a href=#>see that Hsieh needed help</a>. But he waved off her attempts to discuss his precarious mental state.</p><p>“If he kills himself and everyone else in there from a huge fire,” she said as she departed, “you can’t say you were not warned.”</p><p>Three months later, Hsieh was <a href=#>dead, asphyxiated by a fire</a> he sparked inside a locked shed — a coronavirus victim who will never be counted in the pandemic’s official toll.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hsieh, the son of Taiwanese immigrants, was the founder of Zappos. <span class=credit>Danny Moloshok</span></figure><p>“He was absolutely a direct casualty of COVID,” author Kirsten Grind told The Post. “When the world shut down in March 2020, it took away his life’s whole purpose: being around people.”</p><p>In “<a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" data-nyp-affiliate=true>Happy at Any Cost</a>” (Simon & Schuster), out Tuesday, Grind and co-author Katherine Sayre, colleagues at the Wall Street Journal,&nbsp;tell the&nbsp;devastating&nbsp;story&nbsp;of a brilliant man whose hidden mental illnesses doomed him in a locked-down world.</p><p>Hsieh, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who raised him in Marin County, Calif.,&nbsp;was the founder of Zappos. The online shoe-sales&nbsp;company valued employee happiness and was fueled by extravagant parties and a love of “weirdness,” with Hsieh <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">asking potential employees</a>: “On a scale of 1 to 10, how weird are you?”</p><p>“Our number one priority as a company is company culture,” he said in 2010.&nbsp;Workplace joy,&nbsp;he believed, would first create business success, then heal the world’s ills.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hsieh’s friend Jewel, the singer, was shocked by his living conditions before his death. Here, she performs at his eulogy. <span class=credit>YouTube/Jewel</span></figure><p>The first part actually seemed to work.&nbsp;Happy&nbsp;Zappos&nbsp;workers&nbsp;sold millions of shoes, and Hsieh earned an estimated $840 million when he sold the company to Amazon in 2009. He stayed on as Zappos’ CEO.</p><p>Hsieh’s philosophy was fueled by rave culture and by the annual Burning Man festival, where thousands of techies and artists gather for a communal week of wild self-expression. He reveled in&nbsp;the power of what he called the&nbsp;“hive switch,”&nbsp;the emotional charge he felt as part of a large crowd.</p><p>“When you experience it, it is pure&nbsp;awe,” Hsieh said in 2014.</p><p>He spent $350 million to buy up a run-down part of Las Vegas&nbsp;and&nbsp;transform&nbsp;it&nbsp;into a <a href=#>permanent Burning Man community</a>. His quirky life there, in an Airstream trailer park amid a loyal crew of creatives, a constant stream of visitor, and a pet alpaca named Marley,&nbsp;<a href=#>made headlines</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">Hsieh’s philosophy was fueled by rave culture.</figure><p>But beneath the party-hearty facade, Hsieh was beset by untreated mental health problems, including social anxiety, depression and what he believed to be a form of autism spectrum disorder.</p><p>“He was such a contradiction,” Grind said. “With this intense social anxiety,&nbsp;you’d think he would avoid group situations. But instead, Tony&nbsp;derived joy from them.</p><p>“He was drawing on other people’s energy like a drug.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Happy Zappos workers sold millions of shoes, and Hsieh earned an estimated $840 million when the company sold to Amazon in 2009. Hsieh stayed on as CEO.</figure><p>Hsieh never sought&nbsp;professional therapy,&nbsp;but&nbsp;self-medicated, initially with alcohol.&nbsp;At Zappos, “it wouldn’t be odd to see the CEO do a shot in the middle of the day or at a meeting,” Grind and Sayre write, or for underlings to be invited to do the same.</p><p>“I have to drink,”&nbsp;Hsieh&nbsp;once told a girlfriend. “It’s the only way I can live in the now. It’s the only way I can get out of my head.”</p><p>By early 2020, his heavy use of&nbsp;the hallucinogen ketamine had close friends concerned. Hsieh was becoming delusional, speaking&nbsp;with manic intensity about ketamine’s power to rescue humanity from a “Matrix”-like simulation that controlled the world.</p><p>That February, Hsieh agreed to a short stint at a rehab in Park City, where he owned a small vacation home he used during the Sundance Film Festival each year.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">According to “Happy At Any Cost,” Hsieh was plagued by untreated mental health problems, including social anxiety, depression and what he believed to be a form of autism spectrum disorder. <span class=credit>Bloomberg</span></figure><p>“He was acting erratically, and he was the CEO of Zappos,” Grind said. “He had to be very strongly convinced that his behavior could reflect badly on the company. But he did not think he needed&nbsp;rehab.”</p><p>Two weeks later he emerged,&nbsp;drug-free and eager to embark on a plan to create a network of getaway rentals in Park City. He settled there temporarily to buy up houses.</p><p>Then the pandemic hit. The communal lifestyle&nbsp;of&nbsp;his&nbsp;urban&nbsp;trailer park was&nbsp;destroyed&nbsp;as lockdowns and stay-home orders took hold.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hsieh’s sprawling Utah estate became his safe haven during the pandemic where he invited others to stay with him.</figure><p>“Initially&nbsp;you saw him rise to the occasion,” Grind said. Hsieh directed Zappos’ COVID response from Utah, overseeing a smooth transition to remote work for his Las Vegas-based employees.</p><p>But within weeks, “it all just fell apart,” she added. “By the end of March, he was basically calling everyone he’d ever met — and he had hundreds of acquaintances — and essentially saying, ‘COVID be damned, we’re just going to get people here.’”</p><p>Hsieh&nbsp;paid&nbsp;nearly $16 million&nbsp;to buy&nbsp;a mountain compound where he could&nbsp;form&nbsp;a utopian COVID-free community&nbsp;with&nbsp;his growing entourage. The nine-bedroom, 13-bath main house sat on 18&nbsp;acres of land with a private lakefront beach. The deal included a million-dollar enticement&nbsp;for&nbsp;the owners to move out immediately.</p><p>Soon&nbsp;Hsieh&nbsp;was offering to double the salary of anyone who agreed to join his Park City group. The deal drew a flock of flunkies who busied themselves by coming up with&nbsp;harebrained business schemes, like launching hot-air balloons from the ranch’s backyard, that the addled Hsieh&nbsp;funded&nbsp;generously.</p><p>“There was just no incentive for these people to help him get well,” Grind said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hsieh poses with his autobiography, “Delivering Happiness.” <span class=credit>Bloomberg</span></figure><p>And the small group&nbsp;couldn’t satisfy&nbsp;Hseih’s&nbsp;need to&nbsp;interact with scores of different people every day.&nbsp;Soon he was substituting hits of nitrous oxide — also known as whippets and used by dentists as an anesthetic and by chefs to make whipped cream — to chase the high he once got from human contact. He was inhaling 50 canisters a day when Jewel saw him&nbsp;in&nbsp;August.</p><p>By&nbsp;then, Amazon&nbsp;had quietly lost&nbsp;patience with its wayward superstar. Grind and Sayers reveal that Hsieh’s incoherence in a June phone call with Jeff Wilke, the Amazon executive who oversaw Zappos, set off alarm bells at the parent company.</p><p>“Wilke didn’t put him on a formal leave,” Grind said. “He just said, basically, get yourself together, come back, and we’ll figure it out. And Tony was just not able to come back.”</p><p>At the end of August, the Las Vegas Review-Journal ran a brief item:&nbsp;“Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh, Champion&nbsp;of Downtown Las Vegas, Retires.” The party-loving founder didn’t get a good-bye bash or even an official&nbsp;departure&nbsp;announcement from the company he created.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hsieh was staying at the Connecticut home of former girlfriend Rachael Brown when he barricaded himself in the attached shed (on the right of the house), where a mysterious fire led to his death. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>“Amazon didn’t force him out exactly,” Grind said, “But&nbsp;they forced his hand.”</p><p>That fall, Hsieh took his&nbsp;entourage on a&nbsp;frenzied&nbsp;travel spree from Utah to Alaska to Puerto Rico to Connecticut, where they <a href=#>stayed at the waterside home of Rachael Brown</a>, a former girlfriend&nbsp;who had been living at the&nbsp;ranch.</p><p>As the&nbsp;group&nbsp;prepared to head to Hawaii for the next leg of their trip,&nbsp;Hsieh’s&nbsp;elderly dog Blizzy, half-blind and ailing, had to be put down. The animal&nbsp;was&nbsp;buried in Brown’s back yard.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Firefighters at the scene of house fire that led to Hsieh’s death. <span class=credit>Twitter</span></figure><p>“Tony was&nbsp;despondent,” Grind and Sayre write. “He believed he had lost his one true partner.”</p><p>Three days after Blizzy’s death, Hsieh&nbsp;locked&nbsp;himself into a small storage shed filled with pool equipment and folding chairs,&nbsp;a few&nbsp;steps from the dog’s grave. He lit a candle and fired up a propane space heater as he took hits of nitrous oxide. Employees checked on him every few minutes, bringing pizza, water and more whippets.</p><p>Brown’s backyard security system recorded the moment at 3:15 a.m. when Hsieh took his&nbsp;final&nbsp;look at the outside world. Wisps of smoke curled out as he opened the door.&nbsp;He closed himself back in with the smoldering flames.</p><p>He was unconscious, but not badly burned, when the New London Fire Department broke through the door 15 minutes later. But&nbsp;the smoke he inhaled caused catastrophic brain damage.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Hsieh’s death was later ruled an accident. <span class=credit>STEVE MARCUS</span></figure><p>Hsieh never awakened. He died in a nearby hospital on Nov. 27. The cause of death was <a href=#>ruled an accident</a>.</p><p>Days later, Jewel&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>posted a&nbsp;</u><u>touching</u><u>&nbsp;tribute</u></a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;him&nbsp;on Instagram.&nbsp;She recalled a conversation they once had about the meaning of success.</p><p>“His answer was: the willingness to lose it all,” she said through tears. “That’s what it really takes — you have to put your whole heart into something you believe.”</p><p>Gazing into the camera, she sang “Somewhere Over the Rainbow.”</p><p>“Tony, may you be over the rainbow with the bluebirds,” she said. “And your worries far behind.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3N7j2xmampfqLavs8SrZKOdp5q5brzRnpuim6SasW7Ax55knZ2RqbVuu8VmsZqooKTAbq%2FEqGStp56ueqm%2FyJ6faA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fsinger-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html&text=Singer%20Jewel%20predicted%20the%20death%20of%20Zappos%20CEO%20Tony%20Hsieh&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fsinger-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fsinger-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html&title=Singer%20Jewel%20predicted%20the%20death%20of%20Zappos%20CEO%20Tony%20Hsieh" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fsinger-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html&title=Singer%20Jewel%20predicted%20the%20death%20of%20Zappos%20CEO%20Tony%20Hsieh" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fsinger-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html&title=Singer%20Jewel%20predicted%20the%20death%20of%20Zappos%20CEO%20Tony%20Hsieh" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fsinger-jewel-predicted-the-death-of-zappos-ceo-tony-hsieh.html&description=Singer%20Jewel%20predicted%20the%20death%20of%20Zappos%20CEO%20Tony%20Hsieh" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sophie-turner-defends-stranger-things-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sophie Turner Defends 'Stranger Things' Kids -">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ned-fulmer-net-worth-172957.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ned Fulmer Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
