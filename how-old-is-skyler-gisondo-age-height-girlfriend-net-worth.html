He was born under the star sign Cancer on 22 July 1996, in Palm Beach County, Florida, USA, to Stacey and Ron Gisondo., and holds American nationality. His unusual last name comes from his grandfather, who was an Italian-American. Regarding his ethnic background, he has a mix of Italian-Ashkenazi Jewish.</p><h2><span id=Early_life_and_Family>Early life and Family</span></h2><p>Skyler grew up in Florida, and first got into the acting business <a rel=nofollow href=#>at the age of </a>three.</p><p>Acting jobs are known to be time-consuming and very demanding, so his parents decided that it was best he was home-schooled, until he attended a high school. Both of his parents are devout Jewish, so it doesn’t come as a surprise that he attended the high school involved in the Jewish organization USY. He also attended Milken Community High School in Los Angeles, from which he matriculated in 2014. In 2015 he began attending the University of Southern California’s film school as a full-time student, but soon changed to part-time student before taking a break to film ‘The Santa Clarita Diet’. He’s stated in various interviews that he’s determined to finish his college education.</p><p>His father is an engineer who has been dealing with alternative energy for three decades. Reportedly Skyler has a very tight bond, and is very proud of him and his accomplishments, often posting photos of himself and his father. His mother is an ocean engineer – she and Ron married in 1986, and welcomed three children, two older sisters to Skyler, Samara and Jessica. At the moment, they are living in Manhattan Beach in California. Both of them have always been proud of Skyler, especially Stacey, who in a way directed her son’s career and helped him achieve his dreams. Nowadays, Stacey works as a talent manager..</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thebiography.org///thebiography.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/207dea883ed2de7af84119ab63caafcc-819x1024.jpg><p>Despite being a sister of a famous actor, Samara, who is a singer and songwriter, does not like to be in the public eye or present on social media. His other sister, Jessica, is a director of Community and Engagement at Community Honeymoon Israel Foundation.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><p>It could be said that Skyler owes his <a rel=nofollow href=#>succesful career</a> to his mother, who recognized his potential at a young age. She sent photos of him to various agencies, and this landed him a Pizza Hut Commerical, which marked his impending acting career. At the age of eleven he began getting roles in various TV shows and movies, such as ‘Jam’, ‘Air Buddies’, ‘Halloween’, ‘Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story’, ‘Snow Buddies’, etc.</p><p>His first notable role was in the popular American superhero movie ‘The Amazing Spider-Man’.
