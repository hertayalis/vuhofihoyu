She is currently 58 years old. McGee was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in the United States. She is an actress who has acted in films such as “The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug.” She is most known, though, as the wife of comedian and television broadcaster Stephen Colbert.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Evelyn_McGee_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Evelyn McGee? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Evelyn McGee has a net worth of more than $1 million, according to sources, as of 2022, achieved via success in her numerous pursuits. Her fortune is believed to have expanded greatly as a result of her husband’s success, who has a net worth of $45 million. It is projected that her money would grow as she pursues her goals.</p><h2><span id=Evelyn_McGee-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Evelyn McGee- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>While little is known about Evelyn’s childhood, she was born into a well-known family; her father was a litigator for the firm Buist Smythe McGee. After graduating from high school, she enrolled in the University of Virginia’s College of Arts and Sciences in the hopes of pursuing a career in the performing arts. She earned a double major in English and drama in 1985.</p><h2><span id=Evelyn_McGee-_Relationship_Married_Life>Evelyn McGee- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>According to interviews, Colbert met McGee at the world premiere of “Hydrogen Jukebox” at the Spoleto Festival USA in Charleston. He recalled their initial meeting as “love at first sight,” and the two eventually realized they grew up in the same neighborhood and had many mutual acquaintances. Contrary to popular belief, she initially met Jon Stewart in 1990, before meeting her future husband. Evelyn and Stephen were married in 1993, and they have three children. The family now lives in Montclair, New Jersey.</p><p>It is uncertain if she shares her husband’s ideas, but many sources say she does. He is well-known to be a Democrat, and he has declared so in an interview, but he has indicated that he has no problems with Republicans, only with Republican policies. He’s also a fervent Roman Catholic and an ordained pastor at the Universal Life Church Monastery, where he used to teach Sunday school. He lost a bet in 2017 and went on a vegan diet for seven months, but he has since reverted to eating fish, however, he will no longer eat anything with a hoof.</p><h2><span id=Evelyn_McGee-_Professional_Career>Evelyn McGee- Professional Career</span></h2><p>She didn’t acquire many large acting parts, though, due to the way things worked out for her. It wasn’t until 1999 that she was cast in “Strangers with Candy,” a cult classic about a 46-year-old who returns to high school as a freshman. She played Nurse Chestnut in the series, and she would later reprise her role in a 2005 prequel film starring her husband Stephen Colbert.</p><p>Stephen Colbert is an American actor, writer, producer, and comedian who was best known for anchoring “The Colbert Report” from 2005 to 2014 and then “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” the following year. Initially, he aspired to be an actor, but after working as an understudy for Steve Carrell, he became enamored with improvisational theatre. Prior to his appearance in “Strangers with Candy,” he worked as a writer and performer, allowing him to make his mark with his first big part as the openly gay history teacher Chuck Noblet.</p><p>He immediately came to notoriety and recognition as a journalist after joining the cast of Comedy Central’s “The Daily Show.” He left at the peak of his career to host “The Colbert Report,” which followed a similar style to his previous show and rapidly became one of the network’s most popular series, garnering him an invitation to perform at the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner. He has garnered multiple awards, including nine Primetime Emmys, two Peabodys, and two Grammys. One of his most recent projects was hosting the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2017.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>She, like many other actresses, uses social media and has a Twitter account. She only posts a few times a year, primarily in favor of her husband’s initiatives. Her husband, on the other hand, is extremely active on social media, promoting both his program and his political ideas. His show also has its own YouTube account, where bits from previously taped shows are broadcast on a regular basis. His Internet presence is comparable to that of most late-night talk show hosts, many of whom have expanded their online presence.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a href=#>Kwhxte</a>, and <a href=#>Renata Jara</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Jennifer Gimenez</a></h3>Jennifer Gimenez estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
