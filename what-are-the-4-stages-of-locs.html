That said, before embarking on your loc journey, it's important that you familiarize yourself with the five different stages your strands will go through: starter, budding, teen, mature, and rooted.<h2>How do you know your locs are growing?</h2>The Budding Stage (also known as the Sprouting Stage), occurs roughly six to twelve months into your locs journey. This is when you'll start to notice that your hair isn't unravelling when you wash it and notice your new growth, which will look a bit fuzzy and fluffy.<h2>How do I know what stage my locs are in?</h2><li>3 to 6 months: Starter phase of the Loc journey. ...</li><li>6 to 12 months: Budding phase of the Loc Journey. ...</li><li>12 to 15 months: Teen phase of the Loc journey. ...</li><li>15 to 18 months: Maturity phase of the Loc Journey. ...</li><li>From 18 months onwards: Rooted phase of your Loc Journey.</li><h2>How long does the budding stage of locs last?</h2>The budding stage lasts anywhere from month 6 to month 12. You could experience budding at the ends, middle, or closer to the roots of your locs. There's no telling how long the budding stage will last for you since your hair care routine, hair length, and hair texture all play a role.<h2>The 5 Loc Stages You Should Know & What to Expect (Starter Locs to Mature Locs with tons of pics)</h2><p></p><h2>What does it mean when your locs start to bud?</h2>When your locs start budding that means your hair is beginning to tangle inside the loc and form its own internal loc matrix. The internal Loc matrix is essentially a net within the locs that catches all of your naturally shed hair.<h2>How long do locs take to drop?</h2>On average, moving through all these stages can take upwards of 18-24 months; but depending on your texture, density, product usage, and hair care regimen, your hair may move quicker or slower throughout the locking process.<h2>How long does 4c hair LOC take?</h2>Generally speaking, it could take anywhere from 10 months to two years to get to the maturest stage of locs." The process of hair "locking" and the process of these locs maturing are different.<h2>How often should you Retwist locs?</h2>Retwist frequency depends on whether you are in the starter loc phase or you have mature locs. It also depends on the type of locs you have, your hair type and your retwist method. Starter locs should be washed monthly or no more than every six week. If you interlock, you can go as long as eight weeks between retwists.<h2>What does the teen stage of locs look like?</h2>You'll know you're in the teenage phase when your locs appear frizzy but feel and look bigger than they did during the baby phase. After you wash your hair, your coils will feel more solid, more like locs, but still have their frizzy appearance. The good news is, the form is on its way.<h2>How long does it take to see growth in locs?</h2>What is this? It can take anywhere from 10 months to 2 years to grow fully mature dreadlocks, but for most people, the process takes 18 to 24 months.<h2>Can I wash my starter locs after 2 weeks?</h2>You can try to wait at least two weeks before your very first shampoo with your new locs, but it is not completely necessary. On average, I shampoo my hair every 9 days and have done so since I first started them.<h2>How long does it take for locs to thicken?</h2>As long as there are enough hairs per square inch on your scalp to make a bundle of hair as big around as a pencil or so you should have plenty of hair density to make dreads. The dreads will generally phatten up a bit as they mature so you'll gain some thickness/fullness in the first 3/4 months.<h2>What happens if I don't Retwist my locs?</h2>Usually, with soft, curly or fine textures of hair, not retwisting your locs is damaging. One of the biggest problems you'll encounter if your texture is not able to semi-freeform is your hair growing away from your locs. As the hair grows away from the locs, you will experience thinning and sometimes breakage.<h2>Why are my locs so frizzy?</h2>Frizz is an inevitable part of the loc journey and process. Frizz is a sign that your hair is growing and maturing in a healthy manner. Your frizz is needed to continue to form the loc as the hair begins to take the shape, form and mat itself together.<h2>How many locs should you start with?</h2>On average, people who are going for microlock-sized dreadlocks should shoot for a minimum of 150 locs. If you want your microlocks to be really small, go for 400 locs or more. Keep in mind that it will take quite a bit of time to start with such a high number of locs.<h2>Are dreads and locs the same thing?</h2>A notable difference between locs and dreadlocks is that one is a hairstyle and the other is a lifestyle. Locs are cultivated, but dreadlocks aren't. Dreadlocks also often stem from Rastafarian beliefs, which use the style to separate believers from the rest of society.<h2>Do starter locs get thicker?</h2>When you leave your hair alone, your locs are able to flourish and thicken up because they're not constantly “made” into condensed retwisted or interlocked bundles. The ideal timeframe for a retwist is between 4-6 weeks— no earlier!<h2>Can you get dreads wet everyday?</h2>Can you get them wet? Getting the dreads wet ahead of time won't usually cause them any problems, but many people find that if they get their dreads wet without washing them and getting them clean, they get itchy sooner. If you don't find this to be the case then you can get them wet in between washings.<h2>How often should I wash my locs?</h2>Washing, moisturizing, and protecting your dreads will ensure your hair grows well and stays healthy. You will want to regularly (every two to three weeks) wash and detox hair to remove any products, oil, or debris trapped in the strands and scalp.<h2>Can I Retwist my dreads every 2 weeks?</h2>For most textures, at best your retwist may last for 2 weeks. And by “last” I mean stay together, without unraveling and/or loosening at the roots. Before you start shaking your head, understand that this is a common belief when cultivating locs from a holistic approach to hair locking.<h2>When can I wet my dreads?</h2>If you're just getting started with the baby stage, you should wait around 4-6 weeks before carefully washing your hair. You can go even longer than that if you feel you need to, but don't go longer than 3 months.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahmK1lkaeybsDHnmRtZaOprqix0mamn2WcpLC0</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-are-the-4-stages-of-locs.html&text=What%20are%20the%204%20stages%20of%20locs%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-are-the-4-stages-of-locs.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-the-4-stages-of-locs.html&title=What%20are%20the%204%20stages%20of%20locs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-are-the-4-stages-of-locs.html&title=What%20are%20the%204%20stages%20of%20locs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-are-the-4-stages-of-locs.html&title=What%20are%20the%204%20stages%20of%20locs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-are-the-4-stages-of-locs.html&description=What%20are%20the%204%20stages%20of%20locs%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./candice-olson-net-worth-133000.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Candice Olson Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-animals-recognize-their-name.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What animals recognize their name?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
