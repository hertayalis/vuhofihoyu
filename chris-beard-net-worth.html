These calls are sent promptly” on the website of the Austin Police Department.</p><p>The Austin American-Statesman was informed by Perry Minton, Beard’s attorney, that Beard “is 100% innocent of these claims.” Minton told the newspaper that the arrest of the man was inappropriate. “The plaintiff demands his immediate release and the cancellation of all charges.

We are still gathering data and keeping an eye on the legal procedure.”</p><h2>What is Chris Beard’s estimated net worth?</h2><p>As of 2022, basketball coach Chris Beard had amassed a net worth of <strong>$8 million</strong>.
