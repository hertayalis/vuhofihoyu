A few reports indicate that he may have worked as a farmer on a potato farm. However, the exact timeline of his employment or how long he worked there before taking the digital world by storm remains unclear. Despite the mystery surrounding his past, his talent and charisma continue to capture the hearts of his growing fan base.</p><p><strong>See Also-<a href=# rel=noopener>Nonna Giovanna: Everything To Know About The Tiktoker</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=He_Joined_TikTok_In_2021_And_Rose_To_Fame_With_His_Tummy_Dance></span><strong>He Joined TikTok In 2021 And Rose To Fame With His Tummy Dance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yasin Cengiz began sharing his videos on the platform in 2021. On March 5, 2021, he uploaded his first video, in which he could be seen dancing with his belly to the tune of Kubilay Çetin ÖZTÜRK’s song, with the caption “tüm emektrlara gelsin,” which translates to “all veterans” in English. The video immediately gained popularity, receiving 278 thousand likes and numerous comments.</p><p>Ten days later, on March 15, 2021, Yasin uploaded another video of him doing the same belly dance, but this time with the caption “bir pazartesi sabahı neşeli işe başlama yolları,” which means “Cheerful ways to start work on a Monday morning” in English. This video also got over 200 thousand likes and many comments.</p><p>After receiving an excellent reaction to his initial videos, he continued to upload more videos, usually in his work clothes while working on the potato farm. His videos gained more traction, and his popularity began to soar.</p><p>In April 2022, Yasin uploaded another video where he could be seen dancing to Bulgarian singer Biser King’s song Dom Dom Yes Yes, while doing his belly dance. The video immediately went viral, receiving nearly a million likes and over 30 million views. This video catapulted Yasin’s popularity even further, and he continued to use Biser’s song in most of his TikTok videos, making the song even more popular.</p><p>Right now, it is not out of place to say Cengiz’s TikTok journey has been remarkable, and he has gained a considerable following on the platform. His dance moves, particularly his belly dance, have become a signature style in his videos. His content is unique, and his videos have resonated with people, making him one of the most sought-after creators on the platform in Turkey</p><p>At the moment, Yasin’s TikTok account has more than 14 million followers and is still counting. And because the belly dance became his signature, his TikTok fans nicknamed him the “Tummy Dancer.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Yasin_Cengiz_Didnt_Die_As_Alleged_In_2023></span><strong>Yasin Cengiz Didn’t Die As Alleged In 2023</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cengiz was at the peak of his fame when two rumors about his death surfaced in early 2023. However, the Tummy Dancer himself later debunked the rumors and assured his fans that he was alive and well.</p><p>In January 2023, Yasin was first rumored to have died from <a href=# rel=noopener>a drug overdose</a>, and traces of heroin were found in his system. This news came as a shock to his fans, who couldn’t believe that their idol had passed away in such a manner. However, the Turkish TikToker later posted on Instagram that he was alive and well, much to the relief of his fans.</p><p>Interestingly, there was a second wave of rumors about his death when the first had not yet dissipated. This time around, he was reported to have died in the deadly February 2023 Turkey earthquake, which affected an<a href=# rel=noopener> estimated 9.1 million people</a>, with 3 million displaced and 50,783 deaths. However, like in the first case, Yasin came out again to debunk the fake news and assure his fans that he was alive and healthy.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kxqK%2FyKdknJ2enLa7edahmK1lmJa9sbHNnptmrKWiurp5w5qlnJ2iZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fyasin-cengiz-what-happened-tummy-dancer.html&text=Who%20Is%20Yasin%20Cengiz%20And%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Tummy%20Dancer%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyasin-cengiz-what-happened-tummy-dancer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyasin-cengiz-what-happened-tummy-dancer.html&title=Who%20Is%20Yasin%20Cengiz%20And%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Tummy%20Dancer%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fyasin-cengiz-what-happened-tummy-dancer.html&title=Who%20Is%20Yasin%20Cengiz%20And%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Tummy%20Dancer%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fyasin-cengiz-what-happened-tummy-dancer.html&title=Who%20Is%20Yasin%20Cengiz%20And%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Tummy%20Dancer%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyasin-cengiz-what-happened-tummy-dancer.html&description=Who%20Is%20Yasin%20Cengiz%20And%20What%20Happened%20To%20The%20Tummy%20Dancer%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./chia-seed-pudding.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chia Seed Pudding">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-caitlin-mchugh-career-films-awards-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Caitlin McHugh?, Age, Career, Films, Awards, Family, Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
