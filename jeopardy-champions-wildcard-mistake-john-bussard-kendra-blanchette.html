Interesting end to the match. I wonder what John was thinking with that FJ wager.</p><p>A fourth knocked: “They obviously don't teach wagering strategy at Marine aviator school. I'm speechless.

Nearly two-thirds of this season will be tournaments. So yeah, way, way too much."</p><p>"Oh my god, is it really until April?
