Apples pair with cheese perfectly so use an assortment of apples. The green granny smith is tart and crisp and pairs nicely with white cheddar cheese and a drizzle of honey.&nbsp; Thinly slice the apples.</li><li><strong><span>BERRIES</span></strong> — Raspberries, Strawberries, Blackberries all go beautifully with the cheese.</li><li><strong><span>GRAPES&nbsp;<span>—&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><span>Grapes give a nice natural sweetness and crunch to pair with the creaminess of the cheese. Use both green and red seedless grapes.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span>PEARS </span></strong><span><span>— Pears are similar to apples as they are wonderful accompaniments to the cheese. Pears have such a mild flavor to the cheese can be the star.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span>DRIED APRICOTS </span></strong><span>— Known for their sweetness. Buy them fresh to ensure softness.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span>ORANGES </span></strong><span><span>— A burst of citrus is a nice accompaniment.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span>DATES. </span></strong><span>Their nickname is nature’s candy because they are so sweet.&nbsp;</span></li><li><strong><span>FRESH or DRIED CHERRIES.</span></strong></li><li><strong><span>FIGS.&nbsp;</span></strong></li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/How-to-make-the-BEST-Fruit-and-Cheese-Board-94.jpg alt="How to make the BEST Fruit and Cheese Board.

A drizzle of honey adds that perfect sweetness to balance out the sharpness of the cheese. Place it in a small jar or bowl. If you want to really impress your guests, place honeycomb on your platter. We fell in love with honeycomb in Charleston, South Carolina at Savannah Bee Company. <a href=# rel=noopener><span>You can order it online HERE</span></a>.</li><li><strong><span>DARK CHOCOLATE.&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>A little bit of dark chocolate goes a long way. Chocolate pairs beautifully with the berries, apricots, and cheese.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span>CRACKERS and BREAD.&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>Set out an array of crackers and bread&nbsp; — crostinis, flatbread crackers, and thinly sliced crackers. Try to choose plain crackers as strongly flavored crackers can take over the flavor of the cheese.</span></span></li><li><strong><span>OLIVES.</span></strong> Not those canned black olives from the grocery store. If you are serving olives on a cheese platter, grab some from the deli.</li><li><strong><span>FIG JAM/SPREAD.&nbsp;</span></strong><span><span>This adds a nice amount of sweetness and pairs beautifully with fruit, bread, and cheese.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span><strong>CURED MEATS.</strong>&nbsp;<span>Bring in some more savory elements with the additions of salami, prosciutto, and other Italian meats.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><strong><span>PISTACHIOS, ALMONDS or WALNUTS.&nbsp;</span></strong></li><li><span><strong>CANDIED NUTS.</strong></span></li><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/How-to-make-the-BEST-Fruit-and-Cheese-Board-141-ed.jpg alt="How to make the BEST Fruit and Cheese Board.
