When her family came together, and it was often, her home was full, loud, and had standing room only.&nbsp; She would ensure all who wanted to be part of the special event were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would spend hours on the phone calling everyone to get the word out to come over.&nbsp; It was magical.&nbsp; Just the way she liked it.&nbsp; Her sisters and brothers from South Carolina, North Carolina and New York, often times would come on holidays and other special occasions.&nbsp;

(Mark 10:51).&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the burden another carried and offered to help with the load.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the spirit of&nbsp;Naomi!</p><p>Now this beautiful servant, can rest!&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have finished the course&nbsp;and kept the faith!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the gates of heaven where there is a place Jesus has prepared for you!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNopZ%2Bptaa%2BjKeYqKWZYrWiucilq6imXZ%2B8urrEq2Y%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html&text=Mother%20Naomi%20Hamilton%20Joyner%20%20Metropolitan%20Funeral&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html&title=Mother%20Naomi%20Hamilton%20Joyner%20%20Metropolitan%20Funeral" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html&title=Mother%20Naomi%20Hamilton%20Joyner%20%20Metropolitan%20Funeral" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html&title=Mother%20Naomi%20Hamilton%20Joyner%20%20Metropolitan%20Funeral" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html&description=Mother%20Naomi%20Hamilton%20Joyner%20%20Metropolitan%20Funeral" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./robert-garcia.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robert Garcia">&larr;
