She is in it."</p><p id=e3qQFCEojREw data-wc=32>She has since joked that she turns to her daughter for beauty advice, asking for her help with her eyebrows, while Harlow has begun to steal clothes out of her mother's wardrobe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/afe41efb13a5-gettyimages-2126140067.jpg><p id=e3jD3FQ1GFnL data-wc=51>"My daughter loves fashion, but she has her own style.

He always has bruises on him, like you can't take your eyes off him for a second."</p><p id=eV3mEYDOyzRJ data-wc=20>However, he takes inspiration from his rock star dad when it comes to his style, favouring black clothes and bandanas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/9d0116b3de66-gettyimages-2134291912.jpg><p id=eqwNlpMJmi2x data-wc=50>"Sparrow's actually dressing himself now but he's very particular," Richie said of her then-three-year-old son.
